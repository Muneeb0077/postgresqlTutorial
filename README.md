This code demo demonstrates how to connect postgresql to node js and perform CRUD operations on the postgre sql database. 
This can be really helpful for people who want to learn basics of using postgresql with nodejs instead of Mongodb as postgre sql is in high demand in market right now.
All 4 CRUD apis code is also available.
Not that you need postgresql and pg4admin installed from https://www.postgresql.org/ and also your own pg4admin database credentials to add in the main.js code where information is empty.
Hope the code helps you!
